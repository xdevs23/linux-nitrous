config EXFAT_FS

	select NLS
	help
	  This allows you to mount devices formatted with the exFAT file system.
	  exFAT is typically used on SD-Cards or USB sticks.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
	  exfat.

config EXFAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET
	string "Default iocharset for exFAT"
	default "utf8"
	depends on EXFAT_FS
	help
	  Set this to the default input/output character set you'd
	  like exFAT to use. It should probably match the character set
	  that most of your exFAT filesystems use, and can be overridden
	  with the "iocharset" mount option for exFAT filesystems.
